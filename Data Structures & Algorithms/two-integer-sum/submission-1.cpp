 * is there any better approach than this?
 * The current approach using a hash map is already optimal with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). There is no known approach that can solve the two-sum problem in less than O(n) time complexity, as we need to examine each element at least once. Therefore, the hash map approach is considered the best solution for this problem in terms of time complexity .
 * 
 * And if we try to solve this using a sorting approach, we will lose the original indices of the elements, which is required in the output. Hence, the hash map approach is the most efficient and suitable solution for this problem.
